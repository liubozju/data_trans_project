  * 函数功能: 独立看门狗初始化配置
  * 输入参数: Tout = prv/40 * Reload (s) prv可以是[4,8,16,32,64,128,256]
  *            prv:预分频器值，取值如下：
  *            参数 IWDG_PRESCALER_4: IWDG prescaler set to 4
  *            参数 IWDG_PRESCALER_8: IWDG prescaler set to 8
  *            参数 IWDG_PRESCALER_16: IWDG prescaler set to 16
  *            参数 IWDG_PRESCALER_32: IWDG prescaler set to 32
  *            参数 IWDG_PRESCALER_64: IWDG prescaler set to 64
  *            参数 IWDG_PRESCALER_128: IWDG prescaler set to 128
  *            参数 IWDG_PRESCALER_256: IWDG prescaler set to 256
  *
  *            rlv:预分频器值，取值范围为：0-0XFFF
  * 返 回 值: 无
  * 说    明：函数调用举例：
  *           IWDG_Config(IWDG_Prescaler_64 ,625);  // IWDG 1s 超时溢出
